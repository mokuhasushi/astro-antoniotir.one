Aaaand here it is. 

The big drop. 

The end of the time loop. 

Before getting there, the most remarkable events were:
 - Fortov confronting Damien, and behaving like a normal person according to the original setup
 - airships. 
 - becoming Quatach-Ichl disciples. Epic. 
 - seeing Zorian still awkward around girls (lol Neolu)

## The end? 

After some serious build up, a lot of temporary markers left on the support team and numerous sacrifices, they manage to open the gateway to be back. But of course the primordial does not agree with this, and while Silverlake agrees to the offer of helping free it, the others have to fight it off during the ritual. The only looper that gets to escape is Zorian. 

Some nice ethical questions then arise, such as: he is effectively a copy of the original, and going back to the real world he is going after his original body. Effectively killing is old self. Nice. 


Now pace is kicking up, back in the real world with a tight deadline. 
If they do not succeed in stopping the invasion, an angel described the contingencies put in place against the primordial as "scortched earth". 

I am kind of curious as to what would happen, but that would mean Zach death, so I am not sure if the author will let things unroll in that direction. 

Final batter is starting, and I can feel the ending draw nearer! I do hope it won't be too long though, battles are well described and it is nice to see many familiar faces, but the scheming and setups is were the serialisation really excels.

EDIT: only a few chapters where actually remaining, so

## The END

The final takeaway of this piece of art is: *mind magic rocks*.

Big credit to the author in how almost everything ties up nicely. He gifted us a nice ending, without it being cheesy. 

I must say, reading about the neverending learning path of the mc motivated me in picking up again some courses and new skills. So even though it is a light novel, it _had an impact_. 

I only wish there was more necromancy involved, and the final battle was a bit too grand scale. Yes, red robe had a lot of time to prepare and etc, but him raising his skills to such an extent.. It was just to level him to his fellow time travelers, and a tad overpowered. 

Now I am starting to look for my next read, maybe a normal book? I am already almost catch up with the manwha serialisations that were published in the last 2 weeks, so much for being a fast reader...
