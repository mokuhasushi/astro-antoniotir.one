Aaaand here it is. 

The big drop. 

The end of the time loop. 

Before getting there, the most remarkable events were:
 - Fortov confronting Damien, and behaving like a normal person according to the original setup
 - airships. 
 - becoming Quatach-Ichl disciples. Epic. 
 - seeing Zorian still awkward around girls (lol Neolu)

## The end? 

After some serious build up, a lot of temporary markers left on the support team and numerous sacrifices, they manage to open the gateway to be back. But of course the primordial does not agree with this, and while Silverlake agrees to the offer of helping free it, the others have to fight it off during the ritual. The only looper that gets to escape is Zorian. 

Some nice ethical questions then arise, such as: he is effectively a copy of the original, and going back to the real world he is going after his original body. Effectively killing is old self. Nice. 


Now pace is kicking up, back in the real world with a tight deadline. 
If they do not succeed in stopping the invasion, an angel described the contingencies put in place against the primordial as "scortched earth". 

I am kind of curious as to what would happen, but that would mean Zach death, so I am not sure if the author will let things unroll in that direction. 

Final batter is starting, and I can feel the ending draw nearer! I do hope it won't be too long though, battles are well described and it is nice to see many familiar faces, but the scheming and setups is were the serialisation really excels. 

Excited to see where this is going!
