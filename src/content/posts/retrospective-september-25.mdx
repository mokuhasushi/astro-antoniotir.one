I have been through many changes in the past year. I quit my job, I traveled for months and am currently designing the next phase of my life. To make an informed choice, and set plausible goals, I decided to apply some agile methodologies to my personal workflow.

Let me share them with you. 

## Task Tracking

One could argue that the first thing to set is some goal. "I want to publish this video" or "I am going to start a blog". 

Well, of course it is very important toward a specific goal, but going from zero to hero has not provided me great successes in the past. I have also been reading [_Atomic Habits_ by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) and he states clearly that the _how_ is more important than the _what_. 

Hence I started tracking tasks.
I defined a list of simple things that I wanted to accomplish during this month, such as deploying a web service, repimping my website, editing videos or simply organising my work. I used a Trello Kanban board to see clearly how things were moving around. 

I didn't even get to start many of these in the end, but I succeded in some and I feel like I can be proud of this.

And more than the tasks themselves, I used a pomodoro tracking approach. For those unfamiliar with it, it is a work method that makes you take a break after a set amount of time (I use 25 minutes work, 5 break). 

As I am lazy af and just starting this _serious work for myself_ thing, I set my goal to 8 pomodoros per day, about 4 hours. Needless to say, I *failed hard* most of the time. 
And that's ok!  Here is a short summary of what I did:

### Week 1 
Short week, lasted 3 days because of traveling. 

- 7🍅 dithering apis
- 12🍅 editing
- 3🍅 website
- 2🍅 other

Total: 24🍅 or 12h. 

### Week 2
Realised _"other"_ is not very descriptive as task name at the end of the week.

- 11🍅 editing
- 13🍅 dithering apis
- 3🍅 organising
- 12🍅 other

Total: 39🍅 or 18.5h

### Week 3
I was not so good. Focusing on website development was easier than scattering among multiple projects. 

- 6🍅 editing
- 3🍅 career & organisation
- 21🍅 personal website

Total: 30🍅 or 15h

### Week 4
After finalizing a _v1_ for the apis, I started exploring various options for the next big task.

- 8🍅 learning
- 6🍅 writing 
- 3🍅 blogging
- 6🍅 editing
- 9🍅 dithering apis
- 2🍅 other

Total: 34🍅 or 17h

## Results
So, quite a number of hours, about half of a normal work week. Given I've often struggled with motivating myself even for the most basics task after years of no personal effort, I consider this a major success. 

I did not list many activities, such as improving guitar skills (including some rather boring exercises), learning basics of music production, sport and working in the attic. 
I feel like all these activities are not directly tied to my career advancement, or that are already an habit in my life (sports especially). 

One of the results I had was editing a short clip using some tracks I recorded. I had been thinking about something to do with these images since February, so I am very happy about it!

And yes, I have _a lot_ of unprocessed stuff.

I also published some [dithering apis](https://dithering-apis-web-783037558058.europe-west1.run.app/docs), and well, this same website ;-)

I also advanced on some minor projects, before turning to a learning path. 

## Evaluation 
I have been using a _start-stop-continue_ approach week by week to direct my process, and it definetely helped. Either I am a good manager or a good employee, cause the reviews were all the time _overall_ positives. 

This has already been really motivating, so I think it was a tough but necessary first-month. 

I especially feel more resolute and serious about how I tackle challenges. 

I also spent some time actually thinking about m next career steps and evolution, deciding on a rough outline for the next months. 

I am a bit scared about being able to keep this level of efficiency while traveling or having more social interactions, but this is what retrospectives are for, right? 

October has a week in Southern Italy planned, volunteering at a festival in Paris and possibly some quick detour to the Netherlands. Definetely a challenge to keep up the good work, but I am serious about my goals!

Cheers!
