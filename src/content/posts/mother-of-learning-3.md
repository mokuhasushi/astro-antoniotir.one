This is not getting stale, but a bit more linear yes. 

Ever since the immediate threat posed by Red Robe disappeared, and Zach joined MC, things are just running without any major incident. 

Writing is still as good, but perspective has largely shifted from someone considering his every move to a super-powered character who excels at picking up new skills. 

As to say that it is still rewarding to read, but no real high stakes. 

## Damian

The highlights of these chapters has become the battles, and the reunion with MC's sibling. 

Now, battles are not plain boring, but not the reason that got me into this novel. It's fun to read them, and some of the side skills of the protagonist are blended smoothly in the larger picture, but I'd rather read comics for this.

The reunion with his brother Damian, instead, was entertaining. No big surprises, he is largely unaware of how he behaved in the past and the time looper has basically outgrown his hatred for him. A bit dull to be honest. Once again choices have been made to appeal the larger audience, I would say. 

But I am overcriticizing, and it is not easy at all to move forward all these plotlines without letting go of the boy character. Him becoming largely independent and autonomous (he is almost mid 20s, summing all the iterations?) naturally leads to letting go of teen grudges. 

So, no big surprises, good writing, a huge variety in monster encounters. But like many a works sliding down the battle novel path.


On the bright side, this is giving me a bit more space for other activities, as the first arc and a half really had me glued. 

If nothing major catches my attention, I might stop writing every 25 chapters, and go straight to the ending. 

Stay looped!
