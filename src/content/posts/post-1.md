Welcome to my _new blog_ about ~~learning Astro~~ everything! Here I will share my life journey, starting with the development of this website.

## The Astro choice

I spent the last couple of weeks researching several ways to develop and deploy a personal website, and I finally set my eyes on Astro. The getting started tutorial felt very smooth, included deployment on Netlify, and the technology in itself is simple to pick up. 

I know my weak spot is styling, but I found a nice Bootstrap like boostrap bundle, and I am going to try and use it for this website. 

## What's next

First, finalizing this blog and tutorial with styling. Then, updating my personal domain with the new deployment (goodbye S3 rendered markdown!). Then I'd love to advertise my dithering APIs with a dedicated area in the website. 

Also, trying to post something every week should be a good motivator to keep on moving. Quality might vary largely, but continuos delivery should be a priority for a devops engineer ;)
