I recently finished reading [Mother of Learning](https://antoniotir.one/tags/mother-of-learning) and started looking for the next good read. 

I am using [Royal Road](https://royalroad.com) as platform, since it is free and not ad spammed like other websites. I think it is awesome to have such a library of novels at disposal in your smartphone! 

## Tries

I tried reading several stories, mostly giving up after a few chapters. 

Some I completely did not vibe with, like _The perfect run_. I loathed the MC from the first moment, I had a hard time reaching the end of the first chapter. 

Others I kind of liked, but did not feel deeply invested in. I even tried vampires with _A tale of red and black_, but there was way too much misoginy for it to be a pleasant read. 

There are 2 novels I have catched up with and am now following for their regular releases. 
_My new life as a max level archmage_ and _Loopbreaker_.

## Success

The archmage novel is rather fun, but I had actually found and started reading before diving into _Mother of learning_. I will most likely dedicate some posts to its first 50-60 chapters, in order to catch up. 

_Loopbreaker_ is only at around 30 chaps, and releasing every day. Although they are not too long, the frequent releases make up for that. It is my first time trying to read multiple novels in this fashion. I am already used to this for the manwha's serialisations, but the visual aid help largely in keeping track of characters and their specificities. 

Writing some posts about the stories I find sounds like a nice way to keep track of what happens, to me. 

Sooo. _Loopbreaker_. Rather grim medieval low-magic setting. Or maybe _relatively_ low magic setting would be more precise, since the lower castes are cut off from mana usage, but nobles look like they cannot live without it. 

MC is Francis, the 9th son of some Baron. Him and his brother Michael, the 8th (bastard) son have lived a tough life _"treated worse than servants"_ and now enlisted for some great battle thgough magic coercion. 
Apparently, it is believed that powerful traits are inherited only by the first 3 children, so all resources dedicated to bringing up offspring are dedicated to their education. Following kids can hope to pick up some crafting or administrative skills, but being the 9th means he is only a burden to the baron. 

Fun setting. Some degree of violence is expected, and so far delivered by the author. 

And yeah, time loop! Of course I am reading about time loops. First few chapters is setup, picturing how sad and tough life can be for a nameless child and cannon fodder troops. Good pacing, some nice twists. 

And then a bit of plot armor makes the guy defeat a powerful lizard wizard (not named King Gizzard) and obtain the *Undying* skill. Some kind of parasite was living inside the shell of said magician, and when the gecko got defeated it tried to inhabit Francis. Some power of brotherhood (and wrong species remark from the parasite) made him resist the attack, but obtain the power. 

Some questions arise, such as "if the lizard could revive, does it notice the absence of parasite?", "has it died for good?", "if the parasite allows for such crazy growth, how could a skinny weak MC win in the first place?". But many sensible explainations can be given, so let's put these to sleep. 

Going to eat launch, I will try to update regularly about the multiple novels! Cheers!
