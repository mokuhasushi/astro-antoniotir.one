Plot lines. 
More plot lines. 
Even MORE plot lines. 

This is my current opinion of the novel, and I am loving it. 

I am struggling to keep track of all the different arcs and episodes that happen, and I am sitting on my carpet devouring the serialisation. So I totally understand the need of the MC to conveniently store memory packets in his mind. 

## Aranea

A great deal of this second arc is about mind magic, and developing psychic powers. 
In order to do so, of course spider friends are the best allies. Or enemies, since to get used to reading arachno-memories Zorian goes around killing not-always-so-defenseless spider colonies. 

I wonder how would the public react if he instead went around killing settlements of gnomes, even if moderately evil ones. Nobody gets ethical over bugs extermination, huh?

Yet the way the author moved from a single spider web under the big city, to a parallel civilisation nested under the whole region is rather impressive. Goes very smoothly and rather providential to move on his abilities

## Learning

Of course MC is not limited to psychic improvement. After a second arc intro where he quickly faces off Red Robe villain guy, validating most of his paranoia and justifying the need of several more _restarts_ in order to raise his defenses, MC goes on vacation hunting for wolves.

What a classical fantasy! And yet we accept this, because he really needs some stress relief. 

Now regarding his character evolution: as I already complained, he changed too quick. I caught up with author's intention of soul-merging change of personality, but still. A jerk does not become a role model citizien in a couple of years, no matter how many times he has to suicide in front of liches or other necromancers. 

And finally we are getting some real Xvim action. 

While always treated halfway between a comic shoulder and a target for the returner frustration, it was rather evident that he was the best master available. So much love to finally see him give a boost to MC improvement! 

And the _start over_ motive, well, it's just lovely in a time loop novel, right?



Aranea, Xvim, Kael, Silverlake, soul mages, soul trap, golems, romance, thieving around, church involvment, gate assault, lore lore lore, and the list goes on.

Most of this is coherent, and always fun to read. The constant threat of other time travellers keeps the stakes high, the memory packet degradation poses an early deadline, and the development of skills fast enough but allowing for much more space. I am hooked!
