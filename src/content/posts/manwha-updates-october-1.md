I read *a lot* of manwhas. 

Sometimes it is hard to keep track of every serie, hence here is a quick overview of some remarkable updates released last week.


## Nebula Stops
A very sad note to begin with: season 2 end for the Nebula Civilization :(

This has been one of the freshest series lately[^1], mixing RTS elements with good narrative on multiple levels: gods, kingdoms, heroes... A lot of stuff!

After Runda's betrayal has been exposed and Ar "vassalized", the war is starting to look good for Nebula. 
The apostle of Twised Tie raising in power, and after witnessing Larkrak might, I can't help but be excited about a face-off between the two.

This cliffhanger is going to be a grievous one. 

## R O M A N   I S   B A C K 
```
 - Did you only reveal them so that the likes of me would experience despair?
 - Yes, that was precisely my intent.
```
What a quote to kick off the new season of _The heavenly demon cannot live a normal life_. I am thrilled. 
And our dear lord of Dmitry starts with some rather serious provocation to Cronos Emperor, Alexander. 

Forecast is a torrid autumn in Cairo. 


## Diamond for Almond
Almond got Diamond! 

Let's all celebrate the holy nut!

I am positively surprised by how the artists of _Genius archer streamer_ are delivering, the series feels horizontal enough without being repetitive. 
The small cast surely helps in this, and they managed to deliver a real _curveball_ with this promotion arc. 

Now they are discussing the next big game, and the stakes are higher than ever!

## What a Bountiful robbery, Demon Lord!
This demon lord is such a hero, characters tend to be relatively flat and it still looks like a _Greatest Estate Developer_ spinoff... 
But there are also some negative facts about this series. The chapters are too short, for example.

And so demons are eating, a lot of seeds are on their way to the demonic farmlands and Aged Kimchi has let Credos get away with it. Always a source of good laughs.

## The regressed son of the duke is an assassin - End?
Series should be over. 

Why revive Boris? They got a chance to end things by dealing with MC's brother (kudos for not making him a good person in the end). 
They time-skipped 3 years, so I doubt they are going to let it rest at that, and add an arc if not a season. Meh. 

## Other good reads
_Dungeon Odissey_ and _Mr Devourer please act like a final boss_ are about to burst. Big fights ahead, with the Boss themselves going to brawl. 

Devourer especially, as he is going to scold Miss Hexabell quite hard. 

_Myst, Might, Mayhem_ and _Revenge of the Iron-Blooded Sword Hound_ had good chapters released but with no major notes. Some quiet build up before next arcs?


I started reading a couple new series, _Dark Mage Rreturn to Enlistment_ and _The Illegitimate Child Who Devours Weapons_, but they did not strike me as masterpieces. 
Good for filling a couple of days. 

So long!
